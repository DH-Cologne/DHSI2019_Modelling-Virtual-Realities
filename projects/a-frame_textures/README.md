## Setting up your scene

![primitives](../assets/texture.jpg)

Please create a scene which consists of a plane, a box (`<a-box>`), a sphere (`<a-sphere>`), a cone (`<a-cone>`) and a sky (`<a-sky>`).

Exercises:

- Add an image texture to the ground, `<a-plane>`
- Add image textures to `<a-box>`
- Add an image texture to `<a-sphere>`
- Add an image texture to `<a-cone>`
- Add an image texture to the background, `<a-sky>`
- Add a 360° image as a background of your skybox. A good source for 360° images is flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/360.
